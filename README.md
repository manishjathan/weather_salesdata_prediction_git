# Walmart Sales Data Prediction in Stormy weather
The problem is given by Walmart and they have posted this on kaggle and made it into a hiring/recruitment challenge. Sales data related to stores and their corresponding items are provided, along with the weather conditions in each of these stores. Our task is to predict the sales of each of these items in each of the stores.
The plot twist is, it’s not plain simple sales unit prediction. We have to predict these sales during extreme weather conditions such as thunderstorms, heavy fog or rains etc.

## Description

By Solving this problem, we’ll be able to predict the demand of items in each of the stores in a given season and weather condition, thereby enabling Walmart's supply chain system to accurately provide the required quantity of items to each of the stores in time.
This would in turn reduce the pressure on the store managers of managing the demand that is anticipated in a certain weather condition and also reduce wastage of weather or time sensitive products such as egg, milk, bread etc. which are to be cleared out of stock on a regular basis.
